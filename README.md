# JSHexColorCode
By clicking a button you're able to change the current colour of the background using JavaScript and see what the Hex Code for that colour is.

The hexadecimal for the background are chosen randomly (6 times) from an array in order to determine the new background. The value for the background colour is then changed depending on what that hexadecimal is, along with the text in the middle of the screen telling you what the code is.
